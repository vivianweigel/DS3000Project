### Refer to Final_Notebook.ipynb for condensed finalized code and results
A sample data set of dating app data from the UK was analyzed using multiple machine learning algorithms in order to predict what features of a profile lead to success. 
These include random forest regressors, random forest classifier and KNN classifiers.
Data was cleaned and encoded for classification. Then data was split into training and testing sets. 
Results were graphed.
Most code is in jupyter notebooks for clear displays of all results.
